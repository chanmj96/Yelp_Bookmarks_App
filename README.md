Yelp_Bookmarks_App
-------------------

Simple bookmark sharing Android application to extend the bookmarks feature of Yelp. In social gatherings, it may be difficult to decide upon a restaurant to eat at. Rather than create an Excel spreadsheet to collect information about restaurants, our programming team designed an app to store, organize, and share the bookmarks saved in a Yelp user's profile. Urls would be downloaded to the app by pressing a sync button and folders containing urls can be sent to another phone over bluetooth. One further improvement to this application could be implementing a cloud-based server which could improve performance for sharing large Url lists and QR codes for quickly adding many users to a bookmark folder.
